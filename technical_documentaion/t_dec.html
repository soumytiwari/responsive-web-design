        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.</p>

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Variables'>
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).Ex:</p>
        <code>var x = 42.<br/>
        x = 42.<br/>
        let y = 13.</code>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Constant'>
        <header>Constant</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>

      <section class='main-section' id='Data_types'>
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Six data types that are primitives:<li>
    <ul>
      <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
      <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
      <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
      <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
      <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
      <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>and Object</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Function_declarations'>
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
